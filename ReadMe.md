## Instructions for Running the Project

To successfully run this project, you need to execute two Python scripts in sequence. Here are the steps you need to follow:

### Step 1: Update Paths and Choose the Number of Samples

Before running the scripts, update the **path variables** in both scripts to reflect the location of your original data and where you want to save the processed data. Also update the **number of samples**.

### Step 2: Run Scripts

Execute the scripts in the following order:

1. **save_normalised_and_stack_data.py**
2. **save_downscaled_and_normalised_images.py**

Run the scripts using the following commands in your terminal from the project root

```bash
python ./script/save_normalised_and_stack_data.py
python ./script/save_downscaled_and_normalised_images.py
```
